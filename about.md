## About Me

I'm a curious soul, always eager to understand and learn from life. One of the things I love the most is the sea because it brings me peace and a profound sense of freedom, ideals that I endeavour to apply in my profession. Additionally, I take delight in exploring the creative realms of architecture, art, and classical music, firmly believing that the embrace of various art forms fosters our intellectual and social growth.

I hold a deep affection for animals, cherish human connections, and find solace in smiles and warm hugs.

At heart, I'm a dreamer.
